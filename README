This is a DAQ for the 1 Ton WbLS system, written in LabVIEW.
It requires the following:
- The LabVIEW addon h5labview.
- The CAENComm library and CAENVMElib library.

The current VME bridge setup is:
CAENComm -> CAEN A2818 -> CAEN V2718 -> VME modules.

Data are saved in HDF5 format (there are C++/Python libraries that can be used for reading into ROOT).
